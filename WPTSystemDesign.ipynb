    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this document is to come up with a system-level design guidelines and equations for a wireless power transfer system, operating in far-field mode. Such a system can be sized to wirelessly provide DC power to various consumers, such as sensor nodes, wearable electronics, drones, robots, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first instance, the system is assumed to be a point-to-point one, with wireless communication not taken into account. However, it should be fairly straighforward to transition to a multipoint-to-point system where several charging stations serve one end device, and to add communication capability using existing commercial solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of this methodology are the following:\n",
    "- Number of elements for the Tx antenna array $N_{Tx}$ and its respective gain $G_{Tx}$ \n",
    "- Number of elements for the Rx antenna array $N_{Rx}$ and its respective gain $G_{Rx}$\n",
    "- The required Tx power $P_{Tx}$ before the antenna port\n"

    "## Initial Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The main assumption and design goal is that system will be operating in the far-field, i.e. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "R \\geq \\frac{2D^2}{\\lambda}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the distance between the transmitter antenna (Tx) and receiver antenna (Rx), $\\lambda$ is the wavelength corresponding to the centre frequency, and $D$ is the size of the aperture of the Tx antenna. In the case of non-square planar arrays, the larger dimension is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, it is assumed that the designer of the system specifies the DC power required, $P_{DC}$, as well as the RF-DC conversion efficiency $\\eta_{RF-DC}$. This efficiency is itself dependent on the frequency of operation, however it is a parameter that can be tweaked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method also assumes that both the distance $R$ and the wavelength $\\lambda$ are specified, as the equations that have been derived are dependent on both. Initially, the results for $N_{Tx}$ and $N_{Rx}$ will be the arithmetically calculated ones, without rounding to the nearest number that can be expressed as $2^i$. Finally, the inter-element spacing in both $x$ and $y$ directions of the array is assumed to be $\\dfrac{\\lambda}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future iterations of this algorithm, it will be possible to have either $R$ or $\\lambda$ as a free parameter, but other constraints will have to be introduced. Additionally, realistic array configurations will be considered."
